# 🌼 Iris Flower Classification 

In This project we build a simple Machine Learning model to classify **iris flowers** into three species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Classification is based on **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**. The classic Iris dataset is used, which is ideal for beginners in machine learning.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – for machine learning model building and evaluation

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Load the Dataset**
   - Used `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` to import the dataset into a DataFrame.

2. **Explore and Visualize the Data**
   - Checked data types, distributions, and visualized relationships using pair plots and heatmaps.

3. **Preprocess the Data**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

4. **Train the Model**
   - Trained a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** or **Decision Tree Classifier** using scikit-learn.

5. **Evaluate the Model**
   - Evaluated model performance using:
     - Accuracy Score
     - Confusion Matrix
     - Classification Report

6. **Visualize the Results (Optional)**
   - Used `seaborn.heatmap()` to visualize the confusion matrix for better interpretation.

## ✅ Results

The trained model successfully classified the iris species with high accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of basic ML techniques on structured datasets.
